Hi! I’m Yihan, a senior majoring in Statistics (Data Science concentration) and Neuroscience. I have worked on research projects in biomedical and health data science such as identifying significantly differentiated genes in RNA-sequencing data and addressing algorithmic bias in Electronic Health Record data. This past summer, I interned at a health tech startup and got some taste on how health data science is applied in industry! I’m involved with SSMU (Statistical Science Major’s Union) and DTech on campus. I'm passionate about developing and improving technology for social good! Outside of school, I love going to concerts, playing music with friends, hiking, and hunting for good boba!
