Hi! My name is Miles and I’m a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Global Health. I’m passionate about the intersections between technology and global health policy, but I’m excited to see where my interests take me in the future. Outside of class, I’m involved in the stargazing devils club and am hoping to become more involved with global health/health policy groups this year. I also enjoy hiking, coffee, watching soccer, and going to Duke basketball games with my friends!
