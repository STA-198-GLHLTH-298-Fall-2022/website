Hi everyone! My name is Jackie, and I am a second year in the Masters of Statistical Science (MSS) program. I studied Economics for my undergrad at Yale, and after graduating in 2019, I worked in the tech infrastructure department of a bank (i.e. working with developers to create applications for other developers at the bank, very meta I know). I’m interested in neuroscience, specifically in decision-making, but I’m excited to see how my interests evolve. Outside of class, I love baking & watching basketball (mostly the NBA but excited to watch Duke games), and I’m excited to get back into the pool after a hiatus post-collegiate swimming.
