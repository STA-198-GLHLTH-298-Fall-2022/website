Hello, I'm Sam, a second-year PhD student in the StatSci department. I completed my undergrad at UMass Amherst with a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science. Most of my research interests are grounded in statistical or high-performance computing. Recently I've completed internships at Genetech focusing on data visualization and Cruise focusing on data-driven development. Outside of school, I like to explore the Durham area, go to baseball games, and cook.
