Hi! My name is Riya Mohan and I'm a rising junior at Duke. I am currently pursuing a Program II or a self-designed major titled "The Ethical and Regulatory Issues of Human Genomic Editing". At Duke, I'm a Margolis Scholar and am a part of Ethical Tech and Duke Cyber. Outside academic settings, I love coffee, exploring, and reading!
