This slide deck adapted from Data Science in a Box!

Today we'll do the following:

1. Learn how to `tidy` data in the context of cost of medical care

2. Practice data tidying skills to reproduce a plot of presidential approval ratings

3. Practice transforming data from long to wide format and back

4. Practice data wrangling skills to explore US COVID-19 confirmed cases during the pandemic

## Data: Transparency in Medical Pricing

The US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services now requires hospitals to [release pricing information to patients before providing services](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200304.157067/full/). Hospitals have varied in how accessible they have made this data to consumers. For example, Duke Hospital refers patients [to a website](https://www.dukehealth.org/paying-for-care/what-duke-charges-services) that contains a .csv file, and it directs patients to [a financial counselor](https://www.dukehealth.org/paying-for-care/estimate-care-will-cost) to help get estimates (the .csv file is just a list and provides no information about how many procedures may be charged, etc).

The goal of tidyr is to help you tidy your data via

- pivoting for going between wide and long data
- splitting and combining character columns
- nesting and unnesting columns
- clarifying how `NA`s should be treated

## Practice: Child Well Care Visits

Important aspects of well-child medical visits include immunizations, disease detection, and monitoring of growth and development. Barriers to these visits include transportation, time off work, and expense. Let's consider a sample data set (you can input yourself into R!).

```{r sampledata}
#aap 1st week (3-5 days), 1 month, 2 months, 4 months
wellcare <- tibble(name=c("Idara","Fan","Oliver"), visit1=c(0.13, 0.23, 0.17), visit2=c(1,1.07,0.93), visit3=c(2.17,1.93,NA), visit4=c(3.97,4.5,3.67))
```


We'll work with these data in class!

## Coronavirus Deaths

First we call the package that houses the data.  The `coronavirus` package is updated daily, and we should re-install it to get the most up to date data if we want to re-create plots in the future.

This package is not in CRAN (where many R packages live) but is directly on GitHub, so we will install it slightly differently.

```{r load-packages, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(devtools) #to install package from GitHub
#reinstall coronavirus package to update #'s (they update daily)
devtools::install_github("RamiKrispin/coronavirus")
library(coronavirus)
library(lubridate) #to facilitate working with dates
library(glue) #we use in formatting the date
library(scales) #use to control notation on axis scale
library(ggrepel) #for writing names on plot
```

---


## Coronavirus Data

The data frame called `coronavirus` in the coronavirus package provides a daily summary of  COVID-19 cases by country. Each row in the data frame represents a country (or, where relevant, state/province).  Note that the data provided in this package provides daily number of deaths, confirmed cases, and recovered cases. Today we will focus on deaths. 

We will start by making our selection for the countries we want to explore.

---

```{r viewdata}
head(coronavirus) #view variables
```

---
```{r select-countries}

countries <- c(
  "China",
  "France",
  "United Kingdom",
  "US",
  "Turkey"
)
```

---

```{r prep-country-data, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
country_data <- coronavirus %>%
  # filter for deaths in countries of interest
  filter(
    type == "death",
    country %in% countries
  ) %>%
  # fix country labels for pretty plotting
  mutate(
    country = case_when(
      country == "United Kingdom" ~ "UK",
      TRUE ~ country
    )
  ) %>%
  # calculate number of total cases/deaths for each country and date
  group_by(country, date) %>%
  summarise(tot_cases = sum(cases)) %>%
  # arrange by date in ascending order
  arrange(date) %>%
  # record daily cumulative cases 
  mutate(cumulative_cases = cumsum(tot_cases)) %>%
  # only use days since the 10th confirmed death
  filter(cumulative_cases > 9) %>%
  # record days elapsed, end date, and end label
  mutate(
    days_elapsed = as.numeric(date - min(date)),
    end_date     = if_else(date == max(date), TRUE, FALSE),
    end_label    = if_else(end_date, country, NULL)
  ) %>%
  # ungroup
  ungroup()
```


How did we wrangle those data?  First, we filtered to a smaller list of countries, edited long country names if needed, and summed all the deaths by country and date. For some countries like Canada, we have data on the provincial level, so we need to summarize to put data on the country level.

```{r prep-country-data2, eval=FALSE}
country_data <- coronavirus %>%
  # filter for deaths in countries of interest
  filter(
    type == "death",
    country %in% countries
  ) %>%
  # fix country labels for pretty plotting
  mutate(
    country = case_when(
      country == "United Kingdom" ~ "UK",
      TRUE ~ country
    )
  ) %>%
  # calculate number of total cases for each country and date
  group_by(country, date) %>%
  summarise(tot_cases = sum(cases)) %>% #go to next slide
```

---

Next, we ordered by date and calculated the cumulative case counts. Then, we excluded days before the 10th confirmed death due to irregularities in early reporting, and we converted calendar date to days elapsed.

```{r prep-country-data3, eval=FALSE}
  # arrange by date in ascending order
  arrange(date) %>%
  # record daily cumulative cases 
  mutate(cumulative_cases = cumsum(tot_cases)) %>%
  # only use days since the 10th confirmed death
  filter(cumulative_cases > 9) %>%
  # record days elapsed, end date, and end label
  mutate(
    days_elapsed = as.numeric(date - min(date)),
    end_date     = if_else(date == max(date), TRUE, FALSE),
    end_label    = if_else(end_date, country, NULL)
  ) %>%
  # ungroup
  ungroup()
```
---



We also need to take a note of the "as of date" for the data so that we can properly label our visualization.

```{r record-as-of-date}
as_of_date <- country_data %>% 
  summarise(max(date)) %>% 
  pull()
as_of_date_formatted <- glue("{wday(as_of_date, label = TRUE)}, {month(as_of_date, label = TRUE)} {day(as_of_date)}, {year(as_of_date)}")

```

These data are as of `r as_of_date_formatted`.

---



.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Code]
```{r visualise, warning=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = country_data,
       mapping = aes(x = days_elapsed, 
                     y = cumulative_cases, 
                     color = country, 
                     label = end_label)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.7, alpha = 0.8) +

    y = "Cumulative number of deaths",
    title = "Cumulative deaths from COVID-19, selected countries",
    subtitle = glue("Data as of", as_of_date_formatted, .sep = " "),
    caption = "Source: github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus"
  )

We might prefer a plot of daily deaths (here I filter to US - pick your own countries).

  geom_line() +
  labs(
    x = "Date",
    y = "Daily number of deaths",
    title = "Daily US deaths from COVID-19",
    subtitle = glue("Data as of", as_of_date_formatted, .sep = " "),
    caption = "Source: github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus"
  )
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output]
```{r daily2, warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

  geom_line() +
  labs(
